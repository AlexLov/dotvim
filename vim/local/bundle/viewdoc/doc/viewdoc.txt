DESCRIPTION					*viewdoc*

Flexible viewer for any documentation source (help/man/perldoc/etc.) for any
file type inside Vim in easy to use, consistent, smart and configurable way.

 * You can configure how (keys/commands) documentation will be open.
   By default it will replace standard mapping for key <K> and command |:help|
   plus add mapping for <F1> key and new commands |:man|, |:doc|, etc.

 * You can configure where (buffer/window/tab) documentation will be open.
   Can open new docs in one dedicated (<K>) or new (<F1>) buffer/window/tab. 
   Support all work styles (see |viewdoc-settings-examples|):

   - full screen (no tabs, one window, open files/docs are in hidden buffers), 
   - windowed (no tabs, many windows with open files/docs), 
   - tabbed full screen (many tabs, each with one window, open files/docs are
     in different tabs), 
   - tabbed (many tabs with many windows inside tabs). 

 * You can easily navigate to next/previous topic while viewing documentation
   using <C-]> and <C-T> (or alternative keys <CR> and <BS>), just
   like you use tags for navigation within source code and Vim's help.

 * Even closing documentation buffer/window/tab is easier, smarter and more
   configurable than ever before. :)

 * Smart detection of documentation source and topic when opening
   documentation for <cword> (word under cursor) - can use current syntax
   highlight (to find topic's context) and surrounding text (when topic
   doesn't include important special symbols because of 'iskeyword' value).

 * Smart completion for available documentation topics when opening
   documentation using command (just like Vim's |:help| command works).
   (Some documentation sources may not support this.)

 * Supported documentation sources:

   - Vim's help
   - custom documentation in vim help format
   - man pages
   - perldoc
   - pydoc

 * Support for new documentation sources and file types can be easily added by
   external plugins or within ~/.vimrc file.

 * You can have several documentation sources for same file type, and choose
   which one should be used on-the-fly.

 * Can be used as console man page viewer instead of /usr/bin/man.

Tested only in Linux, but should work in any *NIX.

MAPPINGS					*viewdoc-mappings*

Global:~

<F1>	Open doc for <cword> (word under cursor) in new [Scratch] buffer.
	To disable use |g:no_viewdoc_maps|.

K	Open doc for <cword> in existing [Doc] buffer, replacing it current
	contents (will create [Doc] buffer if it doesn't exists yet).
	To disable use |g:no_viewdoc_maps|.

Local to buffer with documentation:~

q	Close this buffer/window/tab, |:quit| from Vim if it was the last one.

<C-]> or <CR>
	Open documentation for <cword> in same buffer.

<C-T> or <BS>
	Return to previous documentation in same buffer (after using <C-]>).

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*viewdoc-commands*

General:~

:doc[!] {topic} [{filetype}]			*:doc*	    *:doc!*
:doc[!] <cword> [{filetype}]
	Abbrev for |:ViewDoc|.
	To disable use |g:no_viewdoc_abbrev|.

:ViewDoc[!] {topic} [{filetype}]		*:ViewDoc*
:ViewDoc[!] <cword> [{filetype}]
	Show documentation for word {topic} or for word under cursor (type
	<cword> literally as is, not as "<cword>" or as expand("<cword>")).

	Without {filetype} will use 'ft' of current buffer to detect which
	one of |viewdoc-handlers| (man/help/perldoc/etc.) should be used to
	show documentation for {topic}/<cword>.

	When used with <cword> handler may use smart detection of context
	when needed - check syntax highlight used for word under cursor or
	surrounding text (which wasn't included in expand("<cword>") because
	of 'iskeyword' value).

	By default will open documentation in new [Scratch] buffer, but when
	[!] is added will open doc in existing [Doc] buffer (will create it if
	not exists yet). Will this buffer open in current window, new window
	or new tab depends on |viewdoc-settings|.

	Examples: >
	    :doc substr perl
	    :doc! <cword>	" same as pressing <K>

Added by man handler:~

:man[!] {sect} {topic}				*:man*
:man[!] {topic}({sect})
:man[!] {topic}
:man[!] {sect} <cword>
:man[!] <cword>
	Abbrev for |:ViewDocMan|.
	To disable use |g:no_viewdoc_abbrev|.

:ViewDocMan[!] {sect} {topic}			*:ViewDocMan*
:ViewDocMan[!] {topic}({sect})
:ViewDocMan[!] {topic}
:ViewDocMan[!] {sect} <cword>
:ViewDocMan[!] <cword>
	Show man page for given {topic} and (optional) {sect}.

	Works in same way as |:ViewDoc| with {filetype}=man, plus:
	* support {sect} as separate first param
	* provide auto-complete for {topic} and ({sect}): >
	    :man tim<Tab>	" auto-complete {topic}
	    :man 2 tim<Tab>	" auto-complete {topic} for section 2 only
	    :man time(<Tab>	" auto-complete {sect}

Added by help handler:~

:help[!] {topic}
:help[!] <cword>
	Abbrev for |:ViewDocHelp|.
	To disable use |g:no_viewdoc_abbrev|.

:ViewDocHelp[!] {topic}				*:ViewDocHelp*
:ViewDocHelp[!] <cword>
	Show Vim help for given {topic}.

	Works in same way as |:ViewDoc| with {filetype}=help, plus:
	* provide same auto-complete and other behaviour as standard |:help|,
	  so it can be used as drop-in replacement

Added by perl handler:~

:perldoc[!] {topic}
:perldoc[!] <cword>
	Abbrev for |:ViewDocPerl|.
	To disable use |g:no_viewdoc_abbrev|.

:ViewDocPerl[!] {topic}				*:ViewDocPerl*
:ViewDocPerl[!] <cword>
	Show perl documentation for given {topic}.

	Works in same way as |:ViewDoc| with {filetype}=perl, plus:
	* provide auto-complete for variables/function/modules/POD/etc.

==============================================================================
SETTINGS					*viewdoc-settings*

General:~

g:no_viewdoc_abbrev				*g:no_viewdoc_abbrev* 
g:no_plugin_abbrev
	Set any of these variables to disable abbrev |:help|, |:man|, |:doc|.

g:no_viewdoc_maps				*g:no_viewdoc_maps* 
g:no_plugin_maps
	Set any of these variables to disable mapping <K>, <F1>.

g:viewdoc_open		="tabnew" (default)	*g:viewdoc_open*
			="topleft new"
			="belowright vnew"
	Control where documentation will be open by choosing Vim command used
	to open new window/tab. You can use any similar commands supported by
	Vim. New documentation buffer will be opened using: >
	    execute g:viewdoc_open	    " to create new [Scratch] buffer
	    execute g:viewdoc_open [Doc]    " to create new [Doc] buffer

g:viewdoc_only		=0 (default)		*g:viewdoc_only*
			=1
	If you open documentation in window (|g:viewdoc_open|!="tabnew"), you
	can force this window to be the "only" window in current tab by
	changing this variable to True value.

g:viewdoc_prevtabonclose=1 (default)		*g:viewdoc_prevtabonclose*
			=0
	If you open documentation in new tab (|g:viewdoc_open|=="tabnew"),
	then when you close that tab Vim by default will move to next tab.
	This plugin by default change this behaviour to move to previous tab.
	If you like original behaviour set this variable to False.

g:viewdoc_openempty	=1 (default)		*g:viewdoc_openempty*
			=0
	If documentation can't be found, empty window with error message will
	be opened. This is default behaviour to make consistent UI experience
	(<q> after <F1> will always return to where you was before <F1>).
	Set this variable to False to avoid opening empty window when
	documentation can't be found (error message will be shown anyway).

g:viewdoc_dontswitch	=0 (default)		*g:viewdoc_dontswitch*
			=1
	By default after opening documentation you'll be switched to
	buffer/window/tab with that documentation (except situation when
	documentation wasn't found and you've set |g:viewdoc_openempty|=0).
	If you prefer to don't change your current buffer/window/tab
	then set this variable to True. This may make sense in
	|viewdoc-windowed| or |viewdoc-tabbed| configurations and probably
	very bad idea in all other cases.

Added by man handler:~

g:viewdoc_man_cmd   ="/usr/bin/man" (default)   *g:viewdoc_man_cmd*
	Should contain command to run `man`. You may wanna change it, for ex.
	to force English manuals: >
	    let g:viewdoc_man_cmd='LANG= /usr/bin/man'
<
						*viewdoc-settings-examples*
						*viewdoc-fullscreen*
Example configuration: full screen~
 * no tabs
 * one window
 * other open files/docs are in hidden buffers
 * navigation between files/docs: |:bn| and |:bp|, close: |:bd| >
    let g:viewdoc_open='new'
    let g:viewdoc_only=1
<						*viewdoc-windowed*
Example configuration: windowed~
 * no tabs
 * many windows with open files/docs
 * navigation/close: CTRL-W something >
    let g:viewdoc_open='topleft new'
<						*viewdoc-tabbed-fullscreen*
Example configuration: tabbed full screen~
 * many tabs
 * each with one window
 * open files/docs are in different tabs >
    " this is default configuration
<						*viewdoc-tabbed*
Example configuration: tabbed~
 * many tabs with many windows inside tabs >
    " same as in windowed example above

==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS					*viewdoc-functions*

This plugin provide global function ViewDoc() and many ViewDoc_{filetype}()
functions, but only |ViewDoc()| function may be called by user (other
functions are documentation handlers called internally by |ViewDoc()|).

ViewDoc({target}, {topic}, {filetype})		*ViewDoc()*
ViewDoc({target}, {topic})
ViewDoc({target}, '<cword>', {filetype})
ViewDoc({target}, '<cword>')
	This function handle all |viewdoc-commands|.

	{target} can be "new" or "doc".
	If it "new", then documentation will be open in new [Scratch] buffer.
	If it "doc", then documentation will be open in existing [Doc] buffer
	(new [Doc] buffer will be created if it doesn't exists yet).
	Using {target}=="doc" is same as using |viewdoc-commands| with [!].

	Other parameters documented in |:ViewDoc|.

==============================================================================
HANDLERS					*viewdoc-handlers*

						*ViewDoc_{filetype}()*
To add documentation handler for new {filetype} it's enough to create one
function in ~/.vimrc (or some plugin): >

    ViewDoc_{filetype}(topic, filetype, synid, have_context)
<
This function will receive 4 parameters:

topic		Requested documentation topic ({topic} or <cword> param for
		|:ViewDoc|, if it was <cword> then it will be replaced with
		expand("<cword>") before calling this function).

filetype	Requested documentation type ({filetype} param for
		|:ViewDoc| or 'ft' if {filetype} param wasn't used).
		Usually will be same as in this function's name, unless you've
		used same function for several file type, like: >
		    function g:ViewDoc_sh(topic, ...) | ... | endfunction
		    let g:ViewDoc_tcsh = function('g:ViewDoc_sh')

synid		Syntax id for requested topic as returned by |synID()|.
		Can be non-zero only if |:ViewDoc| was called with <cword>.

have_context	True if we've context (|:ViewDoc| was called with <cword>).
		If true, then this function may try to analyse topic context,
		like surrounding symbols which wasn't included in topic param.

Examples of calling documentation handler functions:
    1) User press <F1> on word "test" in file "script.sh": >
	    call ViewDoc_man('test', 'sh', 353, 1)
<   2) User run command ":help local-additions" >
	    call ViewDoc_help('local-additions', 'help', 0, 0)

This function must return Dictionary with these keys (all optional): >

    'topic':	String  modified topic, needed if your altered original topic
    'cmd':	String  shell command which should output doc for topic
    'ft':	String  file type for command output
    'line':	Number  position to move cursor after opening doc
    'col':	Number  position to move cursor after opening doc
    'search':	String  regexp to search (to move cursor) after opening doc
    'tags':	String  path to file with tags for this doc
    'docft':	String  file type for navigating with <C-]> inside this doc

For example, here is implementation of |ViewDoc_pydoc| handler: >

    function g:ViewDoc_pydoc(topic, ...)
	    return  { 'cmd':	printf('pydoc %s', shellescape(a:topic,1)),
		    \ 'ft':	'pydoc',
		    \ }
    endfunction
    let g:ViewDoc_python = function('g:ViewDoc_pydoc')

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handler: DEFAULT				*ViewDoc_DEFAULT*

If there is no handler for current filetype then |ViewDoc_man| will be used.
To change default handler to, for ex., |ViewDoc_help|, add to ~/.vimrc: >

    autocmd VimEnter * let g:ViewDoc_DEFAULT = function('g:ViewDoc_help')

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handler: man					*ViewDoc_man*

Show doc using |g:viewdoc_man_cmd| command when {filetype} is "sh" or "man".
Also used as default handler, see |ViewDoc_DEFAULT|.

Added commands: |:man| |:ViewDocMan|.
Added settings: |g:viewdoc_man_cmd|.

To view man pages in Vim from console add this to ~/.bashrc: >

    function man() { vim -c "ViewDocMan $*" -c tabonly; }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handler: help					*ViewDoc_help*

Show standard Vim help when {filetype} is "vim" or "help".

Viewing Vim help using this plugin have some advantages:

 * much better control how and where help window will be opened
 * smart detection (<F1> on "&opt" will show help for 'opt', etc.)
 * and, of course, using <q> to close help

Added commands: |:help| |:ViewDocHelp|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handler: help_custom				*ViewDoc_help_custom*

Show doc for any {filetype} using separate .txt files written in Vim help
format and stored in directory 'runtimepath'/ftdoc/{filetype}/ (no such help
files provided with this plugin, you should download or write them yourself).

Examples of external docs which can be used with this handler:

 * CSS 2.1, from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=918
    Create directory ~/.vim/ftdoc/css: >
	:!mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdoc/css/
<   Copy .txt file from archive into ~/.vim/ftdoc/css/css21.txt, and run: >
	:helptags ~/.vim/ftdoc/css/
<   Add to ~/.vimrc: >
	autocmd VimEnter * let g:ViewDoc_css = function('g:ViewDoc_help_custom')
<
 * CMake, from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3045
    Create directory ~/.vim/ftdoc/cmake: >
	:!mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdoc/cmake/
<   Copy *.txt files from archive into ~/.vim/ftdoc/cmake/*.txt, and run: >
	:helptags ~/.vim/ftdoc/cmake/
<   Add to ~/.vimrc: >
	autocmd VimEnter * let g:ViewDoc_cmake = function('g:ViewDoc_help_custom')
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handler: perldoc				*ViewDoc_perldoc*

Show doc using `perldoc` command when {filetype} is "perl" or "perldoc".

Added commands: |:perldoc| |:ViewDocPerl|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handler: pydoc					*ViewDoc_pydoc*

Show doc using `pydoc` command when {filetype} is "python" or "pydoc".
